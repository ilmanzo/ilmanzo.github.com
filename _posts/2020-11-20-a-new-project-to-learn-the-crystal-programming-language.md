I've started a new side project named [Crystal Koans](https://github.com/ilmanzo/crystal-koans), it's a simple series of
exercises organized as a big unit test suite.

The "koans" are heavily inspired by similar projects for other languages, but I didn't
found anything similar for Crystal. The project has been included in the [awesome collection](https://github.com/veelenga/awesome-crystal) under the official **Learning Resource** for the language.

I'll try to maintain and evolve it in the spare time, I hope you'll find it useful, and any form of contribution is welcome.
