[Nim](https://nim-lang.org/) is a statically typed compiled systems programming language. It combines successful concepts from mature languages like Python, Ada and Modula. It's **Efficient, expressive, elegant** and definitely worth to check.


While I was playing with it, I stumbled upon [an interesting module](https://github.com/yglukhov/nimpy) that allows almost seamless interoperability betweeen Nim and Python; so I'm building a small proof of concept on [this github project](https://github.com/ilmanzo/python-modules-with-nim). More details will come :)
