#About Me#

As you can see, I enjoy minimalism and pragmatic solutions for a problem. I am curious and enjoy learning new things.

If you are interested, you can find my resume following this [link](curriculum.html) or [contact](/index.html) me

#About this site#

This site is entirely static HTML, built with [Jekyll Bootstrap](http://jekyllbootstrap.com/)

I use either [Komodo Edit](http://www.activestate.com/komodo-edit) or [VIM](http://www.vim.org/) to write all content in [MarkDown](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) formatting

After editing or creating, the entire site is versioned and published on [github](http://github.com)

The dark theme is courtesy of [Michele Mattioni](http://michelemattioni.me/)
