&lt;p>You can find the project repository &lt;a href="https://github.com/ilmanzo/package_last_update">on my github&lt;/a>, but it&amp;rsquo;s so simple I can paste also here.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>get notifications about openQA job status</title><link>https://ilmanzo.github.io/post/openqa-jobs-notifier/</link><pubDate>Wed, 05 Oct 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ilmanzo.github.io/post/openqa-jobs-notifier/</guid><description>&lt;p>I got bored of &lt;em>&amp;lsquo;waiting&amp;rsquo;&lt;/em> for an &lt;a href="http://open.qa/">OpenQA&lt;/a> &lt;a href="https://openqa.opensuse.org/">openSUSE&lt;/a> job to complete, so I wrote this quick and dirty script&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For the same purpose there&amp;rsquo;s also the excellent and full-fledged &lt;a href="https://openqa-bites.github.io/posts/2021-02-25-openqa-mon/">openqa-mon&lt;/a>, but I took the chance to learn something by implementing a simpler version myself.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>automate OTP credentials for multi-factor authentication</title><link>https://ilmanzo.github.io/post/otp-generation-from-command-line/</link><pubDate>Tue, 14 Jun 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ilmanzo.github.io/post/otp-generation-from-command-line/</guid><description>Background: I work with one or more terminal command-line always opened and having to pick up my phone to generate an OTP breaks my flow; also it&amp;rsquo;s always nice to have an alternate source of multi-factor authentication if something bad happens, one day you could lose or break your trusty mobile device.
Therefore I was looking for a way to login through Okta portals without a phone. You may argument that this defeats the whole meaning of MFA, but let&amp;rsquo;s say it&amp;rsquo;s only an hack for research and fun purpose &amp;hellip;</description></item><item><title>how to display the IP address of a virtual machine before logon</title><link>https://ilmanzo.github.io/post/know-your-vm-address-before-logon/</link><pubDate>Mon, 05 May 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ilmanzo.github.io/post/know-your-vm-address-before-logon/</guid><description>For testing or development purposes, I do a wide use of small linux virtual machines.
After spawning a new guest (Virtualbox, VMWare or any other), often you want to log on over ssh but you don&amp;rsquo;t yet know its ip address. You need to login as &amp;lsquo;root&amp;rsquo; in the console just to issue a quick &amp;lsquo;ifconfig&amp;rsquo;, and after writing down the address, you logout and connect with your comfortable terminal. In order to save some time and keystrokes, I put this in my rc.</description></item><item><title>Automate Cisco ssh connections with plink in Windows</title><link>https://ilmanzo.github.io/post/plink-automation/</link><pubDate>Mon, 27 May 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ilmanzo.github.io/post/plink-automation/</guid><description>A quick and dirty way to send a bunch of commands to any ssh device (in my case, Cisco appliances)&amp;hellip;
