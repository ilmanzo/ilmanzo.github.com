Therefore I was looking for a way to login through Okta portals without a phone. You may argument that this defeats the whole meaning of MFA, but let&amp;rsquo;s say it&amp;rsquo;s only an hack for research and fun purpose &amp;hellip; So use it at your own risk, and be sure to always protect your credentials: security is a very serious topic.</description></item><item><title>how to display the IP address of a virtual machine before logon</title><link>https://ilmanzo.github.io/post/know-your-vm-address-before-logon/</link><pubDate>Mon, 05 May 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ilmanzo.github.io/post/know-your-vm-address-before-logon/</guid><description>For testing or development purposes, I do a wide use of small linux virtual machines.
After spawning a new guest (Virtualbox, VMWare or any other), often you want to log on over ssh but you don&amp;rsquo;t yet know its ip address. You need to login as &amp;lsquo;root&amp;rsquo; in the console just to issue a quick &amp;lsquo;ifconfig&amp;rsquo;, and after writing down the address, you logout and connect with your comfortable terminal. In order to save some time and keystrokes, I put this in my rc.</description></item><item><title>Automate Cisco ssh connections with plink in Windows</title><link>https://ilmanzo.github.io/post/plink-automation/</link><pubDate>Mon, 27 May 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ilmanzo.github.io/post/plink-automation/</guid><description>A quick and dirty way to send a bunch of commands to any ssh device (in my case, Cisco appliances)&amp;hellip;
