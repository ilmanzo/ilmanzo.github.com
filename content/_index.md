## About Me
 
{{< figure src="/img/foto_lavoro_bn.png" title="Andrea Manzini" width=30% height=30% >}}

Hi! :wave: my name is Andrea Manzini. Iâ€™m an Unix System Administrator and a developer.

As you can see, I enjoy minimalism and pragmatic solutions for a problem. I am focused on delivery, curious and enjoy learning new things.

If you are interested, you can find my resume following this [link](/curriculum) or contact me using social links on this page.
