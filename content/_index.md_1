## About Me
 
![Andrea Manzini](/img/foto_lavoro_small.png)

Hi! :wave: my name is Andrea Manzini. Iâ€™m an Unix System Administrator and a developer.

As you can see, I enjoy minimalism and pragmatic solutions for a problem. I am focused on delivery, curious and enjoy learning new things.

If you are interested, you can find my resume following this [link](/curriculum) or contact me using social links on this page.

If you appreciate my work, you can buy me a book from my [wishlist](https://www.amazon.it/hz/wishlist/ls/20DQF8QV2FJAZ?ref_=wl_share)
