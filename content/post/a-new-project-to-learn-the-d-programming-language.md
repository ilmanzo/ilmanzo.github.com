I've started a new side project named [D Lang
Koans](http://code.dlang.org/packages/dlang_koans), it's a simple series of
exercises organized in a unit test suite.

The "koans" are heavily inspired by similar projects for other languages, but I didn't
found anything similar for D.

I'll try to maintain and evolve it in the spare time, I hope you'll find it
useful.
