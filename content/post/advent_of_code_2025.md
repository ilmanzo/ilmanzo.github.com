## 🎄 Intro 

It is December, the most wonderful time of the year for programmers. But as we log in for [Advent of Code (AoC) 2025](https://adventofcode.com/2025 ), you might notice the atmosphere is a little different. We passed a decade of Eric Wastl’s incredible work, and with this milestone comes a significant shift in tradition.

Before diving into solutions, I want to take a moment to reflect on the state of AoC this year, the changes we are seeing, and why—despite everything—we keep coming back to the terminal.

### The 2025 Format Changes
If you are looking for the Global Leaderboard or preparing for a 25-day marathon, you have likely noticed two major adjustments:

- No Global Leaderboard: The competitive rush has been removed this year.
- A 12-Day Calendar: Instead of the usual 25 days, the event runs for 12 days.

While these changes might feel surprising to veterans, they come with a message of empathy. Maintaining a project of this magnitude for ten years is a grueling, massive commitment. Eric has consistently operated on a whole other level to bring us these elegant, funny, and creative challenges. Acknowledging the "human cost" of this event means supporting the creator’s need to protect his time and mental health.

### Why We Still Solve
In 2025, amid the noise of AI and code assistants, a valid question arises: "Why bother solving puzzles when an AI can do it in seconds?"

The answer is simple: People still go to musicals and live concerts even though Spotify exists.

We don’t do Advent of Code because it is the "efficient" way to get an answer. We do it because *we want to solve the puzzle*. We do it for the thrill, the frustration, and the learning. AoC is a way to reconnect with the simple love of programming. It caters to every level, from the beginner just starting out to the seasoned dev looking for a spark.

### A Generational Tradition
Whether it is 25 days or 12 days, Advent of Code has become a tradition as strong as Star Wars for many of us. It is something to pass down; there are children today wearing AoC pajamas, growing up with these puzzles as a holiday staple.

So, to Eric: Thank you for the last 10 years. We are here for the puzzles, the community, and the tradition—in whatever format works for you.

Now, let's open up the editor and solve Day 1. SPOILER ALERT! 

## ✨ [Day 1](https://adventofcode.com/2025/day/1)

You have a safe with 100-positions dial (0 to 99), and istructions to rotate Left and Right a number of time : `L68 L30 R48 L5 R60 L55 L1 L99 R14` and so on. In the first part, you need to count how many times the dial STOPS exactly at number 0; on the second part (revealed after 1st solution) you need to count how many times it PASSED by the 0 number.
