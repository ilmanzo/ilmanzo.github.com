## *"You sound like a broken record"* 

Is something we complain when someone repeats again and again the same concepts. But even broken disks can sometime be useful... 

DISCLAIMER: No filesystem or device were harmed in the making of this experiment ðŸ˜‰

In this article I would like to explore the tools we have available in linux to simulate dealing with broken disks, that is, drives that more or less randomly report errors. 
Why is this important ? Because by simulating errors that will also happen sooner or later in the real world, we are able to create software that is more robust and can withstand any problems on the infrastructure. 

## Setup

In order not to create problems in our development system, and to make the process as portable as possible, we start by creating a dummy 1GB disk based on the loop filesystem. 

```bash
# dd if=/dev/zero of=/myfakedisk.bin bs=1M count=1024
1024+0 records in
1024+0 records out
1073741824 bytes (1.1 GB, 1.0 GiB) copied, 0.446898 s, 2.4 GB/s

# losetup -P /dev/loop0 blockfile
```

Now we can use the loop device just like any other block device: we can create a filesystem and mount it

```bash
# mkfs.ext4 /dev/loop0
mke2fs 1.46.4 (18-Aug-2021)
Discarding device blocks: done                            
Creating filesystem with 262144 4k blocks and 65536 inodes
Filesystem UUID: bcba505c-54fa-49e5-852c-b5ea3faa53d0
Superblock backups stored on blocks: 
	32768, 98304, 163840, 229376

Allocating group tables: done                            
Writing inode tables: done                            
Creating journal (8192 blocks): done
Writing superblocks and filesystem accounting information: done

# mkdir /mnt/good && mount /dev/loop0 /mnt/good && echo "test" > /mnt/good/test.txt && umount /mnt/good
```

our working "disk" is ready, now we can create a faulty one using linux's [device mapper](https://docs.kernel.org/admin-guide/device-mapper/index.html) features

## What's device mapper ?

The Linux Device Mapper is a kernel-level framework that enables the creation of virtual block devices by mapping physical storage devices or logical volumes to these virtual devices. It operates within the Linux kernel, providing a layer for creating, managing, and manipulating storage devices through various mapping techniques such as mirroring, striping, encryption, and snapshots. This framework allows for the implementation of advanced storage features like volume management, RAID, and thin provisioning, offering greater flexibility, scalability, and reliability in managing storage resources within the Linux operating system.

Basically we are going to create a "map" between our working device and a "new" one, with this schema:

- from sector 0 to 2047, get the data from the underlying device
- from sector 2048 to half disk size, return an error, or the original data, with 20% odds of failure
- from half size to the end, return again the data from the underlying device

Disk size can be found with a simple check:

```bash
# cat /sys/block/loop0/size 
2097152
```

This kind of mapping is expressed in the `dmsetup create` command:

```bash
# dmsetup create bad_disk << EOF
0       2048    linear /dev/loop0 0
2048    1047552 flakey /dev/loop0 2048 4 1 
1049600 1047552 linear /dev/loop0 1049600
EOF

# ls -l /dev/mapper/bad_disk
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 7 Nov 19 17:51 /dev/mapper/bad_disk -> ../dm-0
```

For each table entry, we need to specify:
- start sector/offset of mapping
- size of the mapping 
- which mapper is being used
- options of the mapper 

In this setup we are using the [linear](https://docs.kernel.org/admin-guide/device-mapper/linear.html) mapper and the [flakey](https://docs.kernel.org/admin-guide/device-mapper/dm-flakey.html) one. Another useful can be [delay](https://docs.kernel.org/admin-guide/device-mapper/delay.html) to simulate very slow disks or [dust](https://docs.kernel.org/admin-guide/device-mapper/dm-dust.html) that emulates the behavior of bad sectors at arbitrary locations, and the ability to enable the emulation of the failures at an arbitrary time.

## Let's try it out

Our backing disk is already formatted, so it's time to try out the bad one, by mounting and writing some stuff:

```bash
# mkdir /mnt/bad && mount /dev/mapper/bad_disk /mnt/bad && cd /mnt/bad

# df -h | grep -E '(^Filesystem|bad)'
Filesystem            Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on
/dev/mapper/bad_disk  974M   28K  907M   1% /mnt/bad

 # while sleep 1 ; do dd if=/dev/zero of=trytowrite.bin bs=1M count=500 ; done 
500+0 records in
500+0 records out
524288000 bytes (524 MB, 500 MiB) copied, 0.595353 s, 881 MB/s
500+0 records in
500+0 records out
524288000 bytes (524 MB, 500 MiB) copied, 0.637194 s, 823 MB/s

## Disk failure is a success! 

As we can see, at first some I/O operations succeeds, then disk fails and in `dmesg` log we can find more details:

```

In a more general sense, these concepts fall under the principle of ["chaos engineering"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaos_engineering). 


## Cleanup

To remove the tracks of our experiments, it's sufficient to unmount the "bad" disk, remove the mapping and unassociate the loop device with the backing file. 
```
# umount /mnt/bad && rmdir /mnt/bad
# dmsetup remove bad_disk
# losetup -d /dev/loop0
```
