## üëª Intro

While our [previous post](https://ilmanzo.github.io/post/first_steps_of_ltp_linux_test_project/) focused on the core components of LTP tests, today in this part ~~boo~~ two we're taking a spooky deep dive into the options available in `struct tst_test` ü¶á.

The [Linux Test Project (LTP)](https://github.com/linux-test-project/ltp) began as a collaborative effort between SGI, OSDL, and Bull. Today, it lives with the joint contributions of industry leaders including IBM, Cisco, Fujitsu, SUSE, Red Hat, Oracle, and others. Its mission remains clear: providing the open source community with comprehensive tests that verify Linux's reliability, robustness, and stability. üï∏Ô∏è

## üç≠ Talk is cheap, show me the code

The struct itself is pretty well commented, so we are going to highlight the most important stuff. For the rest, please consult the [documentation](https://linux-test-project.readthedocs.io/en/latest/developers/api_c_tests.html#struct-tst-test)

## 

- line 2: this is the number of the tests that the program contains. If you are using a data-driven approach with many test cases in an array, you want to have this number equal to the array size.

- line 3: a pointer to a null-terminated list of options (TODO)

- line 4: a string describing the minimum kernel version needed for this test. When run on an older one, LTP will automatically exclude this test with an appropriate message

- line 5: A NULL terminated array of architectures the test runs on e.g. {"x86_64", "x86", NULL}.

- line 6: If set the test exits with TCONF right after entering the test library. This is used by the TST_TEST_TCONF() macro to disable tests at compile time.

- lines 7-23: set of boolean flags that enables specific LTP behaviour. For example if `needs_tmpdir` is `true`, LTP will automatically create a temporary directory for our program data.

- lines 24-36: set of options that controls when the test runs or not. For example, if `min_cpus=2`, the test won't run on single-core systems.

- line 37-38: pointers to the `setup` and `clean` functions that will be called only once, before and after the test run 

- line 39-40: mutually exclusive pointers to the actual test code. The first accepts an integer number, useful when you have many test cases for the same function. If the test contains just a single case, you can use the the second one. 

- line 41-42: reserved for internal usage.

- line 43: A NULL terminated array of filenames that will be copied to the test temporary directory from the LTP datafiles directory.

- line 48: A description of guarded buffers to be allocated for the test. Guarded buffers are buffers with poisoned page allocated right before the start of the buffer and canary right after the end of the buffer. See struct tst_buffers and tst_buffer_alloc() for detail.

## üç¨ Enough tricks, gimme a treat  

To see a real usage of these options, let's analyze one of the tests. Taking a simple one like the [swapoff](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/swapon.2.html) syscall; rather than the test itself, we are more interested on the `struct tst_test` usage, but the source it's quite short and reading code is always educational. It's [one of the Free Sofware's four essential freedoms](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html#four-freedoms), isn't it ?

- lines 1-18: standard license and inclusion of LTP header files.
- lines 20-22: definition of some constant values that will be used in the test
- lines 24-41: the real test function. This function basically calls `swapon()` to create a swapfile (aborting when it fails), then tries to stop swapping on that file checking the result.
- lines 43-47: the `setup()` function, executed just once before the start of the test: check if system supports swapping, then create a small swap file using helper functions.
- lines 49: the definition of the `tst_test` parameters for this test:
- line 50: the test requires a new mountpoint: LTP will take care to create it and destroy at the end
- line 51: LTP will formats the device and mounts at the mountpoint specified above
- line 52: device should be at least 350MB in size
- line 52: detect all the filesystem supported by the kernel and automatically repeats the same test for ALL of them
- line 53: this test needs to be run as root. When run as normal user, the exit code will be TCONF 
- line 54: pointer to the actual test function
- line 55: give 60 seconds to run this test. When exceeded, LTP will automatically mark this test with an error
- line 56: pointer to the setup function

As you can see, the test developer needs only to worry about testing the specific feature or functionality, while all the surrounding boilerplate is taken care by LTP framework and utility functions. Very handy!

## üéÉ Conclusion (?)

If you are interested in the LTP project, check out [the project's repository](https://github.com/linux-test-project/ltp) for other documentation and Writing Guidelines; you can also subscribe to [the LTP Mailing List](https://lists.linux.it/listinfo/ltp).
