## üïµÔ∏è Intro

In the [last post](https://ilmanzo.github.io/post/first_steps_of_ltp_linux_test_project/) we only mentioned the most important part of a LTP test. With this articlem, we are going to describe the options available in the `struct tst_test`.

The [Linux Test Project](https://github.com/linux-test-project/ltp) is a joint project started  years ago by SGI, OSDL and Bull developed and now maintained by IBM, Cisco, Fujitsu, SUSE, Red Hat, Oracle and many others. The project goal is to deliver tests to the open source community that validate the reliability, robustness, and stability of Linux. 



## ‚úÖ Conclusion

If you are interested in the project, check out [the project's Wiki](https://github.com/linux-test-project/ltp/wiki) for other documentation and Writing Guidelines; you can also subscribe to [the LTP Mailing List](https://lists.linux.it/listinfo/ltp). Enjoy!
