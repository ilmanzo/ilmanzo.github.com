## üïµÔ∏è Intro

In the [last post](https://ilmanzo.github.io/post/first_steps_of_ltp_linux_test_project/) we only mentioned the most important part of a LTP test. In this articlem, we are going to describe the options available in the `struct tst_test`.

The [Linux Test Project](https://github.com/linux-test-project/ltp) is a joint project started  years ago by SGI, OSDL and Bull developed and now maintained by IBM, Cisco, Fujitsu, SUSE, Red Hat, Oracle and many others. The project goal is to deliver tests to the open source community that validate the reliability, robustness, and stability of Linux. 

## Talk is cheap

The struct itself is pretty well commented, we are going to highlight the most important stuff. For the rest, please consult documentation (TODO: link)

## 

- line 3: this is the number of the tests that the program contains. If you are using a data-driven approach with many test cases in an array, you want to have this number equal to the array size.

- line 5: a pointer to a null-terminated list of options (TODO)

- line 7: a string describing the minimum kernel version needed for this test. When run on an older one, LTP will automatically exclude this test with an appropriate message

- line 13:

- line 16:

- lines 18-48: set of boolean flags that enables specific LTP behaviour. For example if `needs_tmpdir` is `true`, LTP will automatically create a temporary directory for our program data.


- line 135-136: pointers to the `setup` and `clean` functions that will be called only once, before and after the test run 

- line 138-139: mutually exclusive pointers to the actual test code. The first accepts an integer number, useful when you have many test cases for the same function. If the test is a single case, you can use the the second one 

- line 168: array of kconfig options required; when the test is run on a kernel missing some requirement, LTP will skip the test with a message.

- line 173: if your test
