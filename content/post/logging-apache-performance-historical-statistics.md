the [Apache module
mod_status](http://httpd.apache.org/docs/current/mod/mod_status.html) is very
useful for inspecting your running webserver, but it gives you only realtime
informations about workers, connections, and so on. I wanted a way to keep this
data and then be able to do comparison, charts and more useful reports.
The first step was configuring mod_status in order to be only accessible from
localhost:

{{< highlight bash >}}
andrea@myserver:~$ cat /etc/apache2/mods-enabled/status.conf
<IfModule mod_status.c>
#
# Allow server status reports generated by mod_status,
# with the URL of http://servername/server-status
# Uncomment and change the "192.0.2.0/24" to allow access from other hosts.
#
<Location /server-status>
    SetHandler server-status
    Order deny,allow
    Deny from all
    Allow from 127.0.0.1 ::1
#    Allow from 192.0.2.0/24
</Location>

# Keep track of extended status information for each request
ExtendedStatus On

# Determine if mod_status displays the first 63 characters of a request or
# the last 63, assuming the request itself is greater than 63 chars.
# Default: Off
#SeeRequestTail On


<IfModule mod_proxy.c>
    # Show Proxy LoadBalancer status in mod_status
    ProxyStatus On
</IfModule>

</IfModule>
{{</ highlight >}}

now a little shell script to grab the status page together with other useful
informations...

{{< highlight bash >}}
andrea@myserver:~ $ cat apache_status_logger.sh
#!/bin/sh
(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S && links2 -dump http://127.0.0.1/server-status && top -n1 -b) >> /home/andrea/apache_status_$(date +%Y%m%d).log
{{</ highlight >}}


scheduled every 5 minutes with a cron entry like this:

{{< highlight bash >}}
# m h  dom mon dow   command
*/5 * * * * /home/andrea/apache_status_logger.sh
{{</ highlight >}}


you will get for each day a separate file with date, time, apache status, and a
list of running processes with their statistics.
Now you can parse the data with any tool you want; i.e. want to know which was
the busiest days?

{{< highlight bash >}}
andrea@myserver:~$ grep 'requests currently' apache_status_*.log | sort -k2 -nr | head -5
apache_status_20141024.log:   132 requests currently being processed, 0 idle workers
apache_status_20141024.log:   78 requests currently being processed, 0 idle workers
apache_status_20141103.log:   48 requests currently being processed, 3 idle workers
apache_status_20141028.log:   47 requests currently being processed, 2 idle workers
apache_status_20141030.log:   42 requests currently being processed, 0 idle workers
