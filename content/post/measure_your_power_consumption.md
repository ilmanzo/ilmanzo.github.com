## üå°Ô∏è Intro

For those running a datacenter, or just a simple homelab server, the arrival of summer heat means an increase in air conditioning use. On this post I asked myself how a Linux engineer can measure how much energy is the system consuming so we can start to reason about workload optimization for better power consumption patterns.

## üîã Idle power drain

As a starting point, let's measure how much power my PC is consuming when idle, doing absolutely nothing; or better: nothing useful for computation or service but just running usual, default operating system tasks.

There are many way to do it; the most reliable probably is using a proper external power meter device like this one.

Since I'm a software engineers, don't want to mess much with cables; and on many occasion it's not practical to disconnect the servers just to do some power measure. As a pure software solution, some rough measurements can be obtained with the help of [powerstat](https://github.com/ColinIanKing/powerstat) utility, which uses many methods (like battery stats or the *Intel RAPL interface*, which stands for Running Average Power Limit) to estimate the power consumption of a running computer.

```
# powerstat -zR

## ‚ö° Put it to work

So my computer, a ThinkPad P15 Gen 2i, uses ~30 Watts (or ~30 Joule / sec) to do nothing, which if you ask me, I'd rate pretty bad. Let's make some experiments with different workloads, like what every computer should be good at: calculating prime numbers!

The experiment idea is to see how much energy it costs to get the first million prime numbers; accordingly to [prime numbers wiki](https://prime-numbers.fandom.com/) the 1,000,000th prime number should be 15,485,863.

I started with a rather dumb Python program that's on purpose absolutely not optimized:

```python
from math import sqrt

def isPrime(n):
  for j in range(3,int(sqrt(n)+1),2):
    if n % j == 0:
      return False
  return True

n,i = 2,3
while n < 1_000_000:
    i += 2
    if isPrime(i):
        n += 1
print("Prime number =", i)
```

And run it with `powerstat` measurement in background:


```
# (powerstat -zR 1 60 &) ; /usr/bin/time python3 /tmp/prime.py
```

```

 Maximum   7.1   0.0   0.4  93.6   0.1  3.0 4135.0 6576.0  2.0  1.0 10.0  90.93

Summary:
CPU:  56.65 Watts on average with standard deviation 7.55  
Note: power read from RAPL domains: uncore, pkg-0, core, psys.
These readings do not cover all the hardware in this device.

Prime = 15485863

0inputs+0outputs (0major+879minor)pagefaults 0swaps
```

Notice how variable the numbers are over time! So, when doing calculations, my pc almost doubles the power consumption. I keep it safe and say that ~27W is the extra power required to run my poor Python prime number calculator.

Since the program runs for ~61.5 seconds, running it requires ~3490 Joule of energy or 0.0009694444 kWh; of course this is only about the CPU and does not include graphic card, disk subsystem, display, network and so on.

## üìè An alternative measure

Another way to read the RAPL metrics is by using the powerful [perf](https://perf.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/Main_Page) utility. This tool can read many probes exposed from the kernel so maybe in the future we should dedicate it a whole post.

```bash 
# perf list --details power*

List of pre-defined events (to be used in -e or -M):

  power/energy-cores/                                [Kernel PMU event]
  power/energy-pkg/                                  [Kernel PMU event]
  power/energy-psys/                                 [Kernel PMU event]

[output omitted]
```

The `power/energy-cores/` perf counter is part of the Intel RAPL interfaced, based on an CPU MSR register called `MSR_PP0_ENERGY_STATUS`.
The other two are power measurements relative to the package (cores and uncore components) and the entire System on Chip; the latter one is available from Skylake architecture.

Lets' run our Python program asking perf to collect the metrics during the execution:

```bash
# perf stat -ae power/energy-cores/,power/energy-pkg/,power/energy-psys/ python3 /tmp/prime.py
Prime = 15485863

 Performance counter stats for 'system wide':

            695.00 Joules power/energy-cores/                                                   
            930.12 Joules power/energy-pkg/                                                     
           1855.48 Joules power/energy-psys/                                                    

      61.362063830 seconds time elapsed
```
## üöÄ We can do better

for a performance comparison, let's check the same algorithm written in Rust:

```Rust
fn is_prime(n: u64) -> bool {
    let sqrt_n = (n as f64).sqrt() as u64;
    for j in (3..=sqrt_n).step_by(2) {
        if n % j == 0 {
            return false;
        }
    }
    true
}

fn main() {
    let mut n = 2;
    let mut i = 3;

    while n < 1_000_000 {
        i += 2;
        if is_prime(i) {
            n += 1;
        }
    }
    println!("Prime = {}", i);
}
```

Note: we simply translated the Python code, without any attention to optimization.

```bash
$ cargo build --release
   Compiling prime1m v0.1.0 (/home/andrea/projects/prove/prime1m)
    Finished `release` profile [optimized] target(s) in 0.12s

# perf stat -ae power/energy-cores/,power/energy-pkg/,power/energy-psys/ ./target/release/prime1m
Prime = 15485863

 Performance counter stats for 'system wide':

             24.46 Joules power/energy-cores/                                                   
             36.17 Joules power/energy-pkg/                                                     
             82.12 Joules power/energy-psys/                                                    

       2.987509303 seconds time elapsed
```

As expected, to give the same output, the compiled program is ~20x faster, and uses less resources and energy. Sounds interesting!

## üìö Further insights

RAPL (Running Average Power Limit) is a hardware feature introduced by Intel to facilitate power management; the RAPL interface is discussed in Section 14.9 of the Intel Manual Volume 3. 
If you want to know more about this framework, I can recommend also [this research article](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3177754).

The `perf` tool can do much more than reading power metrics from the kernel. If you want to see some examples, check out the ubiquitous [Brendan Gregg](https://www.brendangregg.com/perf.html) website.

Enjoy and happy green computing!
