Who doesn't love cool stickers ?


## Venice, Oct 11, 2025: GDG DevFest 2025

![venezia5](/img/octoberconf_2025/venezia5.png)

Ca' Foscari University has a futuristic design, no wonder they call it *"the Java's Sandcrawler"*

![venezia2](/img/octoberconf_2025/venezia2.jpg)

My proposed talk was accepted here so I went to speak about green computing and how to [measure energy consumption](https://ilmanzo.github.io/post/measure_your_power_consumption/) without any special equipment. Also took the occasion to spread some cool company-provided swag!

(Yes I even managed to spell my name wrong ðŸ˜‘)


## Brescia, Oct 25, 2025: Linux Day

Linux Day is an old-time favorite of mine, since 2001 every year I like to partecipate and share the knowledge and passion about Linux and Open Source. On this edition I had the pleasure to speak in a crowded hall, with lots of young people as well as veteran Linux users.

I gave two talks, one in the morning about the basics of Linux kernel (showing the anatomy of a syscall) and a larger "workshop" about Kubernetes. 

![brescia1](/img/octoberconf_2025/brescia1.jpg)

Very Interesting optical equipment and software for astrophotography

I also brought home this nifty swag that summarizes well the spirit of Open Source: do it your own penguin!  :smile:

# Back home

I'm a huge fan of small, local conferences. They're just so much easierâ€”they're cheap, close to home, and don't eat up your whole week. The networking is way more valuable, too; you're connecting with people who actually work and live in your area.

Plus, the smaller size means less chaos, so you can actually walk up and have a real conversation with the speakers. And if you're thinking about getting on stage yourself, these events are the perfect launchpad. Itâ€™s a low-pressure way to build experience and get your name out there. I can't recommend them enough.
