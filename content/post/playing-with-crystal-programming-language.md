I've started experimenting with the [Crystal Programming Language](https://crystal-lang.org/). It's a nice and clean language with syntax similar to [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org), but compiled to fast native code, and a lot of clever ideas, like [union types](https://crystal-lang.org/docs/syntax_and_semantics/union_types.html) and [seamless C integration](https://github.com/crystal-lang/crystal_lib) The project is still in early stages, but it's promising.

Just to see how easy, I ported [a small python library](https://github.com/kennethreitz/spark.py) to Crystal, you can find it on [https://github.com/ilmanzo/spark](https://github.com/ilmanzo/spark). I hope to find the time to improve on it!
