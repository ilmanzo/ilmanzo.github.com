# Intro: [SYN]

Last 7-8 March 2024 I was at [Open Source Day 2024](https://osday.dev/): a free conference organized by [Schrodinger-Hat Open Source Community](https://www.schrodinger-hat.it/). Two days of talks, meeting old and new friends, networking and fun in [a beautiful city](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florence).

Since the event was split into two tracks, I had to carefully choose which one to attend ; if you are interested [all the sessions was recorded and live streamed](https://osday.dev/agenda). 

| Day  | Stream Recording links   |
|------|-------------|------------|
| 1 | [Alpha Track](https://youtube.com/live/_mA4mvYpU68) | [Beta Track](https://youtube.com/live/te8tNwnej0M) |
| 2 | [Alpha Track](https://youtube.com/live/8owI4xBEIl0) | [Beta Track](https://youtube.com/live/Va6vIYCVxj0) |

Speaking of open source events, each talk proposal is simply an issue on a [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Schrodinger-Hat/osday/issues?q=is%3Aissue+label%3AOSDay-talk), and the selection was done by picking the ones with most "thumbs up" vote from the community. 

I will just post here some highlights and musings, without any intention to detract from those I won't mention :smile:

# First day: [SYN-ACK]

üìú [PJ Hagerty](https://twitter.com/aspleenic) made an examination of the history of Open Source; from naive days of "everything is free for everyone", to the current status where Open Source have become financially a part of everything technology driven. Good hints about how to be a participant and good Open Source citizen.

ü¶Ä [Irine Kokilashvili](https://github.com/mamaicode) introduced [nanocl](https://github.com/next-hat/nanocl), a kubernetes replacement written in Rust started as a study project.

‚ôø [Alessandro Albano](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alessandro-albano-57b015122/) talked about the importance of designing accessible and inclusive software.

üõ°Ô∏è [Abdel Sghiouar](https://twitter.com/boredabdel) gave a wonderful talk about Software Supply Chain Security (SLSA, SBOM), why we should care and how it works in practice.

üõ∞Ô∏è [Sal Kimmich](https://twitter.com/Sal_on_Cyber) brought us to the space, explaining how Linux has been adapted for use in extra terrestrial project, discussing both technical advancements and the broader implications for the open source community.

üëæ followed also two afternoon talks about webassembly, a technology which is catching on. One from [Sohan Maheshwar](https://twitter.com/soganmageshwar) and other from [Noah Jelich](https://twitter.com/NoahJelich); [Edoardo Dusi](https://twitter.com/edodusi) talk about WebAssembly on the next day as well.

üëî last but not least, [Francesco Corti](https://www.linkedin.com/in/fcorti/) made us think about a simple question: [where is Open Source going ?](https://www.slideshare.net/slideshows/from-the-origin-to-the-future-of-open-source-model-and-business/266713630) Is the model sustainable from a business perspective ?

# Second Day: [ACK]

üìà [Nathan Marrs](https://twitter.com/NathanielMarrs) told us the art of monetizing open-source projects without compromising their core principles, with the use case of real-world success story of Grafana.

‚å®Ô∏è [Noam Honig](https://twitter.com/noamhonig) did a live coding session showing off the [*remult*](https://remult.dev/) framework, for seamless backend-frontend integration and fast REST API development.

üîÆ [Christina Dahl√©n](https://www.linkedin.com/in/christinadahlen/) introduced [*lavinmq*](https://lavinmq.com/), an open source message broker engineered for optimal resource utilisation and high performance. As a Crystal language ambassador, I appreciated the use of this underrated language :smile:

üê± [Schr√∂dinger Hat team](https://www.linkedin.com/company/schrodinger-hat/) gave an historic retrospective of the team and a nice review of the last year of their activities.

üî¨ [Costa Tsaousis](https://twitter.com/CostaTsaousis) presented an in-depth overview of building [Netdata](https://www.netdata.cloud/), a powerful open-source, distributed observability pipeline designed to provide higher fidelity, easier scalability, and a lower cost of ownership compared to traditional monitoring solutions. 

üíæ [Federico Terzi](https://twitter.com/terzi_federico) introduced Conflict-free Replicated Data Types in theory and practice. Awesome and easy to follow even for non-Javascript lovers!

üé∏ [Omar Diop](https://www.linkedin.com/in/omar-diop-dev/) Brought us on a musical journey through the world of open source software as he shared the story behind crafting from scratch an online guitar tuner.

üé§ [Francesco Napoletano](https://twitter.com/napodev) explained in a nice way how to fight ageism, and how an over 40 developer can still rock in [10 easy steps](https://www.youtube.com/live/Va6vIYCVxj0?si=Y6ocjJm4DPKWS_dN&t=28050) !

# Goodbye [FIN]

A special **thank you** to all sponsors, in particular to [SUSE](https://www.suse.com) for making this conference and my attendance possible. In the next picture you can see my awesome colleagues Giulio, Luca, and Stefano at SUSE booth. Good work guys!
