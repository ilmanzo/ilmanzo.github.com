It now supports x86_64, aarch64, s390x, and ppc64le. Feel free to use it if you find it useful!\nüìñ The back story If you‚Äôve ever typed qemu-system-x86_64 into your terminal, you know the feeling. A creeping dread. A cold sweat. The QEMU headache. It‚Äôs that special migraine reserved for developers who know they‚Äôre about to spend the next ten minutes deciphering their own shell history to remember that one magic flag for networking.\nThis was my daily reality. My job requires testing software on a whole zoo of Linux versions across architectures like x86_64, aarch64, s390x, and ppc64le. I live and breathe qcow2 images, spinning them up and tearing them down. But every single launch was a fresh new adventure in forgetting flags. Did I add -cpu host for performance? Did I remember -device usb-tablet so my mouse doesn‚Äôt look like it‚Äôs breakdancing in the corner? ü§Ø\nAfter accidentally saving breaking changes to a pristine base image for the hundredth time because I forgot -snapshot, I had a moment of clarity. A glorious, table-flipping moment. ‚ïØ¬∞‚ñ°¬∞Ôºâ‚ïØÔ∏µ ‚îª‚îÅ‚îª\nMy problem wasn‚Äôt QEMU. It was remembering QEMU options. The solution was simple: build a tool so I could forget.\nü•æ A Cure for the Common Command-Line Cold As the project grew, so did my needs. I needed a wrapper script, a quick boot sidekick that was robust, portable, and easy to maintain. The prescription was clear:\nA Single Pill: One self-contained binary. No side effects, no dependencies, no ‚Äúmake sure you have Python 3.9.x installed.‚Äù\nEasy to Modify: It had to be readable enough that ‚ÄúFuture Me‚Äù wouldn‚Äôt curse ‚ÄúPast Me.‚Äù\nThe Right Tool for the Job: Powerful enough to handle complexity, but simple enough for a small side project.\nInitially, I wrote this tool in D, but as I looked to the future of the project, I knew I needed something else. So I decided to rewrite it in Go. üêπ\nGo wasn‚Äôt just the popular kid on the block; for a project like this, it was the perfect evolution. It hit every single one of my wishlist items with pragmatic grace:\nSingle Executable? ‚úÖ Go compiles to a static native binary by default. My qboot helper is just one file, ready to rock on any Linux system. Deployment? Solved.\nLinux Love? ‚úÖ Go‚Äôs cross-compilation is legendary. Building for aarch64, s390x, and ppc64le from a single machine is trivial, not a weekend-long project.\nReadability \u0026 Power? ‚úÖ‚úÖ This is where Go excels for CLI tools. Its syntax is clean, simple, and incredibly easy to pick up. The robust standard library has everything you need for files, commands, and networking. Plus, features like goroutines and channels, while maybe overkill for this tool today, give me room to grow without over-engineering. It‚Äôs all the power I need with none of the fuss.\nüíÜ Headless by Default I started crafting the qboot tool, defining a VirtualMachine struct to hold all the options. This ‚Äúobject-oriented‚Äù approach meant my VM‚Äôs configuration was neatly separated from the complex logic of building QEMU commands. No more spaghetti code!\nMy qboot tool was designed around my two main workflows:\nü§ñ Headless Mode (The Default): This is for my daily testing grind. It runs with -nographic and, most importantly, uses a -snapshot so my base images are untouched. It‚Äôs fast, it‚Äôs clean, and it‚Äôs as disposable as a paper cup. This mode is the reason I can now sleep at night.\nüßë‚Äçüíª Interactive Mode (-i for ‚ÄúI need to see!‚Äù): This is for manual surgery. When I need to actually log in, create a user, or install something, this mode pops up a GUI, enables a non-possessed mouse, and disables snapshots so my changes are saved.\nTo make it even more brainless, qboot auto-creates a config.json file in ~/.config/qboot/ on its first run. I just set my default CPU and RAM in there once, and I‚Äôm done. Forever.\n‚ôªÔ∏è The Glorious Result My workflow has been transformed.\nBefore qboot (The Headache):\n$ qemu-system-x86_64 -m 8G -cpu host \\ -enable-kvm -drive file=... wait, what was the syntax for virtio again? *opens Google* After qboot (Headless Bliss):\n$ ./qboot -d my-disk.qcow2 That‚Äôs it. It just works. If I need to do some setup first:\n$ ./qboot -d my-disk.qcow2 -i My QEMU headache is gone, replaced by the quiet hum of a tool that does exactly what I want.\nüí≠ Final Thoughts While Go has already won the popularity contest, it‚Äôs worth repeating why it‚Äôs a perfect fit for practical command-line utilities.\nFast Compilation \u0026 Execution: Go compiles incredibly fast, making the ‚Äúedit-compile-run‚Äù loop a joy. The resulting binary is performant, starting instantly.\nSimplicity is Genius: It offers a small, focused set of features that are incredibly effective for building reliable and maintainable software. You spend your time solving problems, not fighting the language.\nDeploy Anywhere: The ability to cross-compile to a single, dependency-free binary is a superpower. Sharing your tool with others or deploying it to different machines is effortless.\nSo, the next time you‚Äôre tired of wrestling with command-line options for your dev tools, or need a quick, performant, and easily deployable utility, give Go a whirl. You might just find your own gopher sidekick. ‚ú® It certainly saved my sanity from QEMU Tetris!\nProject repository can be found at https://github.com/ilmanzo/qboot .
