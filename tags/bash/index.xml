For the same purpose there&amp;rsquo;s also the excellent and full-fledged openqa-mon, but I took the chance to learn something by implementing a simpler version myself.
#!/bin/sh JOB=$1 if [ -z &amp;#34;$JOB&amp;#34; ]; then echo &amp;#34;please provide job number as parameter&amp;#34; exit fi MESSAGE=&amp;#39;Your job is ready!&amp;#39; JOBURL=https://openqa.opensuse.org/tests/$JOB while : do STATE=$(openqa-cli api -o3 jobs/$JOB | jq .</description></item><item><title>automate OTP credentials for multi-factor authentication</title><link>https://ilmanzo.github.io/post/otp-generation-from-command-line/</link><pubDate>Tue, 14 Jun 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ilmanzo.github.io/post/otp-generation-from-command-line/</guid><description>Background: I work with one or more terminal command-line always opened and having to pick up my phone to generate an OTP breaks my flow; also it&amp;rsquo;s always nice to have an alternate source of multi-factor authentication if something bad happens, one day you could lose or break your trusty mobile device.
Therefore I was looking for a way to login through Okta portals without a phone. You may argument that this defeats the whole meaning of MFA, but let&amp;rsquo;s say it&amp;rsquo;s only an hack for research and fun purpose &amp;hellip;</description></item></channel></rss>
