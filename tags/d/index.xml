Then the size of input data grew, and also for a language comparison, I wanted to port my utility in the D programming language, but I cannot find an equivalent module, so I decided to write one myself.</description></item><item><title>Hijack C library functions in D</title><link>https://ilmanzo.github.io/post/hijack-c-library-function-in-d/</link><pubDate>Tue, 10 Mar 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ilmanzo.github.io/post/hijack-c-library-function-in-d/</guid><description>I like playing with the D programming language and I wrote this little post to show how it&amp;rsquo;s easy to create a dynamic library (shared object, .so) that can be invoked in other programs; to have a little fun we will write a D replacement for the rand() C standard library function call. For your convenience, all the code is also on github
Let&amp;rsquo;s start with the demo implementation, a C program that calls 10 times the stdlib function rand() to get a random number.</description></item><item><title>a very simple NTP client in D</title><link>https://ilmanzo.github.io/post/a-simple-ntp-client-in-d/</link><pubDate>Thu, 20 Feb 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ilmanzo.github.io/post/a-simple-ntp-client-in-d/</guid><description>I am quite a fan of the D programming language and I think it deserves more attention, even if since a few months it&amp;rsquo;s becoming more and more popular, as it gained top20 in the TIOBE Index for February 2020.
As an experiment in network programming, I took this simple NTP client written in C and translated to D ; in my opinion while it&amp;rsquo;s keeping the low-level nature, it&amp;rsquo;s shorter, clearer and more effective.</description></item><item><title>A new project to learn the D Programming Language</title><link>https://ilmanzo.github.io/post/a-new-project-to-learn-the-d-programming-language/</link><pubDate>Sun, 07 Dec 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ilmanzo.github.io/post/a-new-project-to-learn-the-d-programming-language/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;ve started a new side project named D Lang Koans, it&amp;rsquo;s a simple series of exercises organized in a unit test suite.
The &amp;ldquo;koans&amp;rdquo; are heavily inspired by similar projects for other languages, but I didn&amp;rsquo;t found anything similar for D.
I&amp;rsquo;ll try to maintain and evolve it in the spare time, I hope you&amp;rsquo;ll find it useful.</description></item></channel></rss>
