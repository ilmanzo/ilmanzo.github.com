For your convenience, all the code is also on github
Let&amp;rsquo;s start with the demo implementation, a C program that calls 10 times the stdlib function rand() to get a random number.</description></item><item><title>a very simple NTP client in D</title><link>https://ilmanzo.github.io/post/a-simple-ntp-client-in-d/</link><pubDate>Thu, 20 Feb 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ilmanzo.github.io/post/a-simple-ntp-client-in-d/</guid><description>I am quite a fan of the D programming language and I think it deserves more attention, even if since a few months it&amp;rsquo;s becoming more and more popular, as it gained top20 in the TIOBE Index for February 2020.
As an experiment in network programming, I took this simple NTP client written in C and translated to D ; in my opinion while it&amp;rsquo;s keeping the low-level nature, it&amp;rsquo;s shorter, clearer and more effective.</description></item><item><title>A new project to learn the D Programming Language</title><link>https://ilmanzo.github.io/post/a-new-project-to-learn-the-d-programming-language/</link><pubDate>Sun, 07 Dec 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ilmanzo.github.io/post/a-new-project-to-learn-the-d-programming-language/</guid><description>learn D programming language by solving simple exercises</description></item></channel></rss>
