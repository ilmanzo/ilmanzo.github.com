As an experiment in network programming, I took this simple NTP client written in C and translated to D ; in my opinion while it&amp;rsquo;s keeping the low-level nature, it&amp;rsquo;s shorter, clearer and more effective.</description></item><item><title>linux: how to access DHCP options from client</title><link>https://ilmanzo.github.io/post/access-dhcp-options-from-client/</link><pubDate>Mon, 06 Nov 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ilmanzo.github.io/post/access-dhcp-options-from-client/</guid><description>As you may know, you can configure any DHCP server to send many options to the clients; for example to setup dns domains, http proxy (WPAD) and so on.
If you need to access these options from a linux client, you must configure the client to ASK the server for the new options, by editing /etc/dhcp/dhclient.conf, and add an entry like:
option WPAD code 252 = string; also request WPAD; done that, when you&amp;rsquo;ll ask for a dhcp, the dhclient process will invoke your hook scripts with two new environment variables, old_WPAD and new_WPAD, with the values before and after the renewal.</description></item></channel></rss>
