Therefore I was looking for a way to login through Okta portals without a phone. You may argument that this defeats the whole meaning of MFA, but let&amp;rsquo;s say it&amp;rsquo;s only an hack for research and fun purpose &amp;hellip; So use it at your own risk, and be sure to always protect your credentials: security is a very serious topic.</description></item></channel></rss>
