&lt;p>Curious about who and how attempts ssh login to your home server ? Me too&amp;hellip; So I wrote a very simple ssh honeypot, just to collect interesting info about the kind guys who knocks my door :)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>warning: this is safe, but don&amp;rsquo;t run the service (well, ANY service) as root user. Even better if you can run it as a dedicate unprivileged user.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This program is only for didactic use and not intended for deployment in a production network environment.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you want to have it exposed on the public internet, you must map port 22 of your wan router to the internal server port ( 2222 by default)&amp;hellip; Do it at your risk!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Automate Cisco ssh connections with plink in Windows</title><link>https://ilmanzo.github.io/post/plink-automation/</link><pubDate>Mon, 27 May 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ilmanzo.github.io/post/plink-automation/</guid><description>A quick and dirty way to send a bunch of commands to any ssh device (in my case, Cisco appliances)&amp;hellip;
