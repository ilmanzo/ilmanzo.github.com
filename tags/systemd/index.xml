However, we can achieve isolation between internal tasks of an operating system by leveraging a technology exposed by the kernel: cgroups. This component is also used by Docker, and other Linux container technologies.
Cgroups are the Linux way of organizing groups of processes: roughly speaking a cgroup is to a process what a process is to a thread: one can have many threads belonging to the same process, and in the same way one can join many processes inside the same cgroup.</description></item></channel></rss>
